# SVXConnect-Qt's own source is MIT, and it links Qt 6 under the LGPLv3.
# That combination is legal and needs nothing but dynamic linking and the
# notices in THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES. But Qt's open-source edition is NOT uniformly
# LGPL: a handful of modules are GPL-3.0-only, and linking one silently
# converts the whole binary to GPLv3 while LICENSE still says MIT. Nothing in a
# normal build tells you this has happened — it is a licence bug that compiles,
# links, runs and ships.
#
# Qt Charts is the one people actually hit, because it is the obvious way to
# draw a meter or a level history. There is no LGPL charting module in Qt 6 at
# all. Verified: qtcharts' upstream LICENSES/ directory contains GPL-3.0-only,
# BSD-3-Clause and the commercial reference, and no LGPL text; Debian's
# qt6-charts-dev declares "License: GPL-3+". Qt's own licensing page omits
# Charts and Data Visualization from its GPL-only list only because both are
# deprecated — a future reader will misread that omission as "they are LGPL".
#
# The substitute is to draw it yourself: QPainter in paintEvent for the VU
# meters and level history, QGraphicsScene/QGraphicsView for anything
# scrollable. That is a few hundred lines, and it is what the macOS app ended
# up doing anyway for performance reasons.
#
# This file provides svx_find_qt6(), which is BOTH the guard and the
# find_package call. Keeping them as one avoids the failure mode where the deny
# list and the component list drift apart, or where a contributor adds a second
# find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Charts) on a new line and bypasses the check
# entirely. The CMake-time guard is still only advisory — tools/licence_guard.sh
# inspects the real link graph after the build, which is what actually counts.
