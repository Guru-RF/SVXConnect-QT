# Exactly two files in the CLI tree must be excluded, and both for a concrete
# reason rather than tidiness:
#   src/main.c    — the only int main() in the tree; linking it would collide
#                   with ours and pull in the whole CLI argument parser.
#   src/ui/ui.c   — the only <ncurses.h> consumer; linking it would add a
#                   dependency on libncursesw to a GUI that never draws a
#                   terminal, and would show up in dpkg-shlibdeps output.
# Everything else — all 24 remaining translation units — is wanted.

# Dependencies
#
# libopus's headers live in /usr/include/opus, so the include path is NOT
# optional — codec.c does #include <opus.h> and fails without it. That is what
# PkgConfig::OPUS carries, and it is the one thing a hand-written -lopus misses.
#
# -lresolv is required: common/net.c uses res_query() and ns_initparse() for
# SRV lookups. On glibc 2.34+ these moved back into libc for some symbols but
# not all; link it explicitly rather than depending on which.
#
# There is deliberately NO ALSA or PulseAudio dependency here. miniaudio
# dlopen()s libasound.so.2 / libpulse.so.0 at runtime — that is what -ldl is
# for — which is why no -dev package is needed to build, and equally why
# dpkg-shlibdeps cannot see them and debian/control must name them by hand.
