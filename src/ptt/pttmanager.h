 * Owns the PTT backends and turns their edges into app_ptt().

 * Presses are reference-counted rather than boolean, so that a second source
 * releasing while a first is still held does not drop the carrier mid-word.
 * Only the portal backend exists today; the counting is what makes adding
 * another (a foot switch, say) a change of one file rather than of this

 *
 * THE SAFETY RULES, WHICH ARE THE POINT OF THIS CLASS
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * A missed release is an unattended transmitter. Three independent defences,
 * all required, none sufficient alone:
 *
 *   1. tx_timeout_sec in the core (120 s by default) hard-unkeys regardless of
 *      what any of this does. It is the backstop and must never default to 0.
 *   2. Any backend emitting lost() unkeys immediately. A control that has just
 *      told you it can no longer see the release is not a control.
 *   3. Every error path unkeys. If this class is ever unsure of the state, it
 *      stops transmitting.
