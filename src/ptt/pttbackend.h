 * Global push-to-talk: one interface, several backends.
 *
 * This is the feature the macOS app was never allowed to ship — its
 * HotkeyManager still carries the comment explaining that
 * NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents was flagged under App Store guideline
 * 2.4.5 — and the one a terminal cannot offer at all, because a terminal
 * delivers characters, not key events, so there is no release to detect.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS HARDER THAN A NORMAL GLOBAL SHORTCUT
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * A shortcut needs one edge: the activation. Push-to-talk needs BOTH edges,
 * and the release is the safety-critical one. A missed press is an annoyance;
 * a missed release is an unattended transmitter sitting on the air. Every
 * backend below is therefore judged first on whether it can report a release
 * at all, and PttManager treats "unkey" as the safe default in every error
 * path.
 *
 * THE FOUR BACKENDS
 * -----------------
 *   portal   org.freedesktop.portal.GlobalShortcuts. Works on Wayland and
 *            X11, needs no elevated permission, and — verified on Plasma
 *            6.3.6 with xdg-desktop-portal 1.20.3 — emits both Activated and
 *            Deactivated. The default.
 *
 *   fifo     The core's existing control FIFO, driven by a compositor key
 *            binding. Already works with no code at all; it is listed so the
 *            interface can report on it and the settings page can explain it.
 *
 * An evdev backend reading /dev/input/event* directly was written and then
 * REMOVED. It was the only way to bind a chord using CapsLock, because at that
 * layer CapsLock is just KEY_CAPSLOCK going down and up rather than a lock
 * state the shortcut layer discards — but it cost read access to every key the
 * device produces, which for a keyboard is every keystroke the user types.
 *
 * That turned out to be solving the problem at the wrong layer. The desktop
 * already offers it: the xkb option `caps:hyper` ("Make Caps Lock an
 * additional Hyper", in KDE's Keyboard → Key Bindings settings) turns CapsLock
 * into a real modifier, Hyper and Super share Mod4, and CapsLock+Enter is then
 * simply LOGO+Return — an ordinary portal binding, with no elevated permission
 * and no udev rule, that benefits every application rather than this one.
 *
 * A MEASURED WARNING ABOUT preferred_trigger
 * ------------------------------------------
 * The portal's preferred_trigger is a HINT. Tested against
 * xdg-desktop-portal-kde 6.3.5, with a distinct app id per probe so nothing
 * was served from kglobalaccel's cache:
 *
 *     CTRL+SHIFT+t  ->  "Ctrl+Shift+T"     honoured
 *     CTRL+Return   ->  "Ctrl+Return"      honoured
 *     F12           ->  "F12"              honoured
 *     SUPER+p       ->  ""                 rejected outright (the spec's
 *                                          modifier is LOGO, not SUPER)
 *     CAPS+Return   ->  "Return"           CapsLock SILENTLY DROPPED
 *
 * That last row is a live footgun. Asking for CapsLock+Enter and not checking
 * the reply leaves you bound to bare Enter — every time the operator presses
 * Enter in any application, anywhere, the transmitter keys. PortalBackend
 * therefore validates what came back and refuses a binding that lost its
 * modifiers, rather than trusting the request.
