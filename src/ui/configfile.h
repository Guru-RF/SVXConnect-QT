 * Opening svxconnect.conf in the user's text editor.

 * Until the Preferences dialog exists (M3), and afterwards for the keys it

 * The file is shared verbatim with SVXConnect-CLI — one identity, one config —
 * so this is also how the two clients stay in agreement.
 *
 * WHY QDesktopServices AND NOT $EDITOR
 * ------------------------------------
 * $EDITOR and $VISUAL name a TERMINAL editor. Launching vi from a GUI process
 * with no controlling terminal gets you nothing at all — and on this class of
 * desktop both variables are typically unset anyway. The desktop's registered
 * handler for text/plain is the right answer: it is what the user already
 * chose, it goes through the OpenURI portal when sandboxed, and it is how
 * every other GUI application opens a text file.
 *
 * xdg-open is kept as a fallback for the case where the Qt platform theme
 * cannot reach a portal or a .desktop database.
