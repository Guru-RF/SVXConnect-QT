 * One row in the talkgroup sidebar.

 * Carries five pieces of state at once — selected, muted, priority, someone
 * talking, when last heard — which is why it is a painted QAbstractButton
 * rather than a QPushButton wearing a stylesheet. A QSS rule set that covered
 * every combination of :checked, muted, and traffic would be longer than this
 * paintEvent and would fight the desktop theme at every step.
 *
 * The colours come from Theme:: and the surfaces from the palette, so it
 * inverts correctly in a dark theme without a second stylesheet.
