 * Who is talking now, and who was talking recently.
 *
 * v1 has two sections, both fed from the core's talkgroup manager:
 *
 *   LOCAL    tg_manager::active[] — talkers on the talkgroups you monitor,
 *            as reported by the reflector over TCP. Live, counts up.
 *   RECENT   tg_manager::recent[] — the last 16 finished overs.
 *
 * The macOS app has a third, REFLECTOR: 24 hours of sessions from the enhanced
 * reflector's WebSocket feed, which is the only source of other nodes'
 * coordinates and of history from before you connected. That feed is beyond
 * v1, so the section does not exist yet. When it lands, this is where it goes,
 * and the gating rule to copy is: show Reflector when the feed is up, and fall
 * back to Recent when it is not — the macOS app shows NEITHER when enhanced
 * mode is on but the feed is down, which leaves an empty panel for no reason.
 *
 * Rows are rebuilt only when the content actually changes, keyed on a cheap
 * signature. The relative-time labels are refreshed in place every tick
 * without touching the row structure — that distinction is the whole reason
 * this is not a QListView with a model reset.
