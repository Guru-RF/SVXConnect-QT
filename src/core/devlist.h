 * Audio device enumeration for the pickers.
 *
 * Thin, but not trivial, because of one thing worth surfacing:
 * svx_audio_resolve() returns 1 when it matched a specific device and 0 when
 * it fell through to the system default. That zero is the only way to learn
 * that a device the user pinned is no longer present — a USB headset that is
 * unplugged, a dock that is undocked — and the picker must SAY so rather than
 * quietly showing the default as though nothing happened. The macOS app
 * resets the stored id to "default" and logs; doing nothing would leave a
 * stale id in the shared config file that the terminal client then inherits.
 *
 * svx_audio_list() spins up a miniaudio context and takes tens to hundreds of
 * milliseconds, so it is called when a picker opens, never on a repaint tick.
