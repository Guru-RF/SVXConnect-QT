 * The single-owner run lock.
 *
 * Exactly one process may hold the reflector connection: the same client
 * certificate and node id cannot be used twice at once. The ncurses TUI,
 * `svxconnect --headless`, the GTK GUI on Raspberry Pi OS and this application
 * all take the same advisory flock() on cfg.lock_file before connecting.
 *
 * WHO ELSE IS OUT THERE
 * ---------------------
 * The lock file records a `kind` string, and the three existing owners use:
 *
 *     "cli"       the ncurses client
 *     "headless"  svxconnect --headless, i.e. the systemd unit
 *     "gui"       SVXConnect-PIOS, the GTK client on Raspberry Pi OS
 *
 * We register as "gui-qt", NOT "gui". This is not cosmetic. PIOS's main.c
 * takes the lock as "gui" and expects an incumbent to be raised by
 * kill(pid, SIGUSR1). We raise over a QLocalSocket and do not install a
 * SIGUSR1 handler. If both were "gui", then on a Pi with both installed the
 * second launch would connect to a socket that does not exist, hang until the
 * connect timed out, and then report the wrong thing. Distinct kinds let the
 * raise path pick the right mechanism per holder — and it must, because a Pi
 * with both installed is a case the packaging explicitly contemplates.
 *
 * The status file's owner field is a fixed char[16], so any kind string must
 * stay short.
 *
 * `svxconnect --enroll` deliberately does NOT take this lock (verified: the
 * CLI's main.c calls enroll_run() with no acquire), so the enrolment wizard
 * works while this application holds it.
