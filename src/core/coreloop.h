 * SVXConnect-Qt — Copyright (c) 2026 Diëlectricum BV
 *
 * Runs the SVXConnect-CLI core inside the Qt event loop.
 *
 * The core is written around poll(). app.h states the contract in one
 * sentence: "app_service() must be called every time round the loop even when
 * poll() returned nothing, because it also drives the timers."
 * SVXConnect-PIOS folds this into a custom GSource; Qt gets a set of
 * QSocketNotifiers plus one single-shot QTimer, both funnelling into one slot.
 *
 * Three facts drive the design, and each has a specific known failure mode.
 *
 * 1. THE FD SET IS DYNAMIC. rc_poll_fds() always returns the connect worker's
 *    wake pipe, and adds the TLS and UDP sockets only while a connection
 *    exists — which the worker opens and closes as it reconnects. The events
 *    mask is dynamic too: POLLOUT appears on the TLS fd only while
 *    tls_want_write().
 *
 * 2. THE TIMER MUST BE AN ABSOLUTE DEADLINE, RE-ARMED EVERY PASS — not "ask
 *    again how long". PIOS's appsource.c documents the failure verbatim: while
 *    transmitting, app_next_timeout_ms() never reaches 0 because the core keeps
 *    asking for a short poll to drain the mic ring. A naive implementation then
 *    only ever services on inbound fd activity, so RECEIVE WORKS AND TRANSMIT
 *    SILENTLY NEVER SENDS. QTimer::start(ms) is a real deadline, which makes
 *    this correct by construction.
 *
 *    Related, and worth knowing before someone "optimises" it: app.c clamps the
 *    timeout to 20 ms whenever audio is ready, NOT only while connected. An
 *    idle, disconnected, tray-resident SVXConnect therefore wakes at 50 Hz
 *    forever. That is deliberate — it is the jitter buffer's tick — and
 *    removing it breaks playback.
 *
 * 3. QSocketNotifier IS LEVEL-TRIGGERED AND MUST NEVER BE LEFT ENABLED ON A
 *    CLOSED FD, or the event loop spins at 100% on POLLNVAL.
 *
 * ON NOT DESTROYING NOTIFIERS
 * ---------------------------
 * The obvious implementation rebuilds the notifier set whenever the fd set
 * changes, with deleteLater() for safety. That has a real, reachable bug.
 * deleteLater() defers to the event-loop level at which it was called. Open a
 * modal dialog (Preferences, a QMessageBox), let the connection drop and
 * reconnect while it is up, and the pending DeferredDelete events do not run
 * until the nested loop exits — by which time reconcile() has already created a
 * replacement notifier on the same fd NUMBER, because the kernel reuses the
 * lowest free descriptor after a close(). Qt then prints
 *
 *     QSocketNotifier: Multiple socket notifiers for same socket 9 and type Read
 *
 * and behaviour is undefined.
 *
 * So notifiers are never destroyed on the reconcile path. They are keyed by fd
 * number, created on first sight, and thereafter only enabled and disabled. A
 * disabled notifier on a closed fd is inert and costs nothing. Entries that
 * have been absent for a long time are pruned on a slow maintenance timer that
 * cannot be running inside a notifier's own emit.
