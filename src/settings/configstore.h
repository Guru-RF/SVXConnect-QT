 *
 * Writing svxconnect.conf back out.
 *
 * The core can read a configuration and set individual keys in memory, but it
 * has NO config_save — nothing in SVXConnect-CLI ever writes the file. The
 * terminal client tells you to edit it by hand, so it never needed one. A
 * Preferences dialog does.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT "SERIALISE THE STRUCT"
 * --------------------------------------
 * The obvious implementation is config_dump() to a temporary file and rename
 * it over the original. That is what ConfigFile::createDefault() does, and for
 * a file that does not exist yet it is exactly right.
 *
 * For a file the user already owns it is destructive. This file is shared
 * verbatim with the command-line client and is meant to be hand-edited — the
 * comments in it are the documentation. Dumping the struct would silently
 * delete every comment, every blank line, every bit of grouping and ordering
 * the user put there, and reorder the keys into the core's internal table
 * order. Changing the transmit timeout should not rewrite the file.
 *
 * So this is a read-modify-write over the original text: only the value of a
 * changed key is replaced, in place, and everything else — including the
 * trailing comment on that very line — survives byte for byte. A save that
 * changes nothing produces a file identical to the input, which is the
 * property tests/test_configstore.cpp checks.
 *
 * THE PARSER IT HAS TO MATCH
 * --------------------------
 * config_load() (config.c:395-422) does, per line: strip a comment starting at
 * an unescaped '#' or ';'; trim; split on the FIRST '='; trim both halves;
 * remove one layer of matched quotes from the value. Keys are
 * case-insensitive. When a key appears more than once the LAST occurrence
 * wins, because config_set() is simply called again — which is why save()
 * rewrites every occurrence of a changed key rather than just the first.
