 * The talkgroup manager must keep BOTH spellings of a callsign.
 *
 * Regression test for a real bug: the interface showed "ON6URE" for a station
 * transmitting as "ON6URE-TPAD", because tgm_on_talker_start() stripped the
 * SSID before storing and the full form was gone for good.
 *
 * The stripped form still has to exist, and still has to be what MATCHING
 * uses — the reflector can report a stop with a different SSID than the start,
 * and roger-beep self-suppression must recognise your own audio coming back
 * from any of your nodes. So the fix is to keep both, not to stop stripping.
